1. The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:
    The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
    The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
    The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
    
   Solution
   if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = 3
    b = 2
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)
  
2. The included code stub will read an integer,n, from STDIN.
Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
1234....n
Note that "...." represents the consecutive values in between.
Example n = 5
Print the string 12345
Solution
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        print(i+1,end="")
